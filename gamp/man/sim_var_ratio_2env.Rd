\title{Simulate MSE for GxE and Additive Model on A Grid With Difference Effect Sizes
And Environmental Variance Ratios}
\usage{
sim_var_ratio_2env(sigma_ratio, fx_diff_grid, se_grid)
}
\arguments{
\item{sigma_ratio}{ratio of standard errors between environments}

\item{fx_diff_grid}{grid of differences in effect size}

\item{se_grid}{grid of standard errors of regression coefficients}
}
\value{
dataframe with various metrics for the GxE and additive models.
}
\description{
This code allows the user to specify a grid of ratios of environmental
variance between environments
and a grid of differences in effect size between environments
(normalized by the standard error).
